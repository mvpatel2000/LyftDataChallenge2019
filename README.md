## Value Criterion
To maximize value to Lyft, a driver will consistently drive high value rides which best fit demand from customers. This can be achieved by maximizing:
	Time: Maximizing the number of rides. This means increasing driver retention, especially for frequent drivers.
	Supply: Increasing driver presence during peak times to meet currently unmatched demand (represented by high prime time value in the data), improving customer experience and capturing potentially lost rides.
## Thesis
Through a statistical and visual analysis of driver data and supply-side information, we have identified certain cohorts of drivers (stratified by number of rides, active days, weekend versus weekday, primetime-heavy) and structure in the data that lead us to a lifetime value function LTV(driver)=time*supplyas defined in “Implications for Lifetime Value”. We defer categorizing drivers to each component of the function, which we believe is more informative and less ad hoc.
